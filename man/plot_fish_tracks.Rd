\title{Plot simulated fish tracks with detection events}
\usage{
plot_fish_tracks(
  simulation_results,
  raster,
  receiver_frame = NULL,
  show_detections = TRUE,
  path_alpha = 0.7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation_results}{List output from \code{\link{simulate_fish_tracks}}
containing tracks, detections, and station_detections.}

\item{raster}{A RasterLayer object used as the background for plotting.}

\item{receiver_frame}{An sf object containing receiver station locations.
Default is NULL.}

\item{show_detections}{Logical. Whether to display detection events on the plot.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{path_alpha}{Numeric. Transparency level for path lines (0-1). Default is 0.7.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing fish tracks, detection events, and receiver stations.
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of simulated fish movement paths overlaid on a raster
background, showing detection events and receiver station performance.
}
\details{
The plot includes:
\itemize{
\item Raster background (typically depth or habitat)
\item Fish movement paths colored by path ID
\item Detection events: yellow circles (successful), red X marks (missed)
\item Receiver stations: sized by detection count, colored by activity
}

Receiver station visualization:
\itemize{
\item Green circles indicate stations with detections
\item Red circles indicate stations with no detections
\item Circle size scales with number of detections
}

The function automatically handles different simulation outputs and adapts
the visualization based on available data (tracks only vs. full detection simulation).

\dontrun{
# Generate and plot fish tracks
fish_sim <- simulate_fish_tracks(
  raster = depth_raster,
  detection_system = detection_sys$data,
  station_distances = distances,
  n_paths = 2,
  n_steps = 100

# Basic plot
plot_fish_tracks(fish_sim, depth_raster, stations)

# Plot without detection events
plot_fish_tracks(fish_sim, depth_raster, stations, show_detections = FALSE)

# Customize path transparency
plot_fish_tracks(fish_sim, depth_raster, stations, path_alpha = 0.5)

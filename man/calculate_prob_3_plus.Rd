\title{Calculate probability of detecting signal on 3 or more receivers}
\usage{
calculate_prob_3_plus(probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{probs}{Numeric vector of detection probabilities for individual receivers.}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the probability of detection on 3+ receivers.
Returns 0 if fewer than 3 receivers are available.
}
\description{
Helper function that computes the probability of a signal being detected
by at least 3 receivers using binomial probability calculations.
}
\details{
Calculates P(X >= 3) = 1 - \link{P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)} where X is the number
of receivers detecting the signal. Uses exact binomial calculations rather
than approximations.

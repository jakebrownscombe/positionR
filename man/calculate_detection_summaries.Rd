\title{Calculate detection rate summaries from fish track simulations}
\usage{
calculate_detection_summaries(simulation_results)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation_results}{List output from \code{\link{simulate_fish_tracks}}
containing tracks, detections, and station_detections data frames.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{overall}{List with total_steps, detected_steps, detection_rate, and detection_percentage}
\item{by_path}{Data frame with detection statistics for each individual path}
\item{summary_stats}{List with mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation of detection rates}

Returns NULL if no detection data is available.
}
\description{
Computes detection performance metrics including overall detection rates,
per-path statistics, and summary statistics across all simulated fish tracks.
}
\details{
The function analyzes detection success at each step of simulated fish tracks,
providing both aggregate and individual path performance metrics. This is useful
for evaluating receiver array effectiveness and optimizing system design.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simulate fish tracks with detections
fish_sim <- simulate_fish_tracks(
  raster = depth_raster,
  detection_system = system_DE$data,
  n_paths = 5,
  n_steps = 100
)

# Calculate detection summaries
detection_stats <- calculate_detection_summaries(fish_sim)

# Access overall performance
overall_rate <- detection_stats$overall$detection_percentage

# Access per-path performance
path_performance <- detection_stats$by_path
